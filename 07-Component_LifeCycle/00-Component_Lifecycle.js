/*
    Two Types of Components Exist in React : 
    1. Functional Component
    2. Class Component

    Component has their LifeCycle.
    Now Question is what is Lifecycle.

    LifeCycle : A LifeCycle is the series of stages through which a living 
            thing passes from the beggining of its life until its death.

    A Component lifecycle is replaced from living thing to component in case
    of Component Lifecycle.

    When a Component is used in the Another component its says that component 
    is created or we can say when component is used in DOM in technical term
    this is called the Mounted, and when a Component is removed from the DOM
    this is called death of component means lifecycle is end for this component
    in the technical term it's unmounted, Different Phases of Component life 
    cycle is exist
*/

/*
    Different Phases of Life Cycle :

    1. Mounting : When Component is Created and Put inside the DOM
    2. Updating : When Comonent is Updated
    3. UnMounting : When Component is Removed from the DOM
    4. Error Handling : When Error is occure During Rendering of Component
*/

/*
    Side Effects : SideEffects are nothing but unpredictable actions because 
            they are performed with the "outside world".

    When we call the Browser API then it'll be consider as the side effect 
    because browser API is external to React not the Internal to the React
    including the native DOM methods instead of native react DOM methods it
    is also called the side effect because it's not consider in the React but
    React DOM method is also a side effect.

    If we fetching the Data through API it's also considered the side effect 
    and if we also subscribe or call any database it's also side effect including
    react we perform multiple side in some place

/*
    We Know that Components in React are two types :
    - Functional Components
    - Class Components
*/

/*
    Class Component is Some Different from functional Component so first if 
    we need to create component from class we need to inherit properties of 
    component from React by using the extends React.component.

    In Class Component a render function will be need to present which returns
    some JSX and that is render on to the screen.

/*
    JSX : JSX Stands for Javascript XML. JSX is the extension which provides 
        us more convinient way to write code in React, We need to understand 
        that it's just a syntactic sugar internaly working should be same as 
        previous because again and again createElement using React it's hard 
        to write long syntax like :

        React.createElement("div",{className : "header"},"This is Heading");

        JSX Provide us more convinient way to write code in react instead of like 
        this we can write code same as "HTML", because JSX just combination of 
        HTML and Javascript but browser not support any other languages except
        HTML, CSS and Javascript so question is how can browser understand this
        JSX file, for this many compiler is exist which manage JSX file and
        converts this JSX file into seprate HTML and Javascript so browser is
        able to understand that JSX format file.

        Compiler which we used for is "Babel".

        as we know that react is a javascript library so for using the react we 
        need to download the whole package of react or instead of this we can use 
        the CDN(Content Delivery Network), so we can easily use react features just
        link two script files.

        Two types of React version is Exist one for Development Level and Another 
        one is for Production Level because in Development phase we need some extra

        in the case of production which is optimize version of react which contains 
        only necessory things.

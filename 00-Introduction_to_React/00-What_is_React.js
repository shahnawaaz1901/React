    Why React : 
        - React is Composable : Any Complex task we can Devide into multiple smaller 
                    components or smaller parts for reducing the Complexity of UI. 
                    This helps us to core reusability. Components is Just like a
                    Javascript function or something else of javascript code

        - Build Single Page Applications : What is single Page Application, Single 
                    Page Applications is the applications which has only one html 
                    Document. It helps us to Prevent web page Reload again and again 
                    instead of this changes made dynamically. That's is the reason 
                    performance is very high of this applications. Simple Javascript 
                    can able to create this single page applications but using simple 
                    javascript it's very complex to create.

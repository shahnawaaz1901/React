/*
    Babel : Babel is Javascript Compiler Which helps us to Provide Compatibility 
        of Code to the current or older versions of browser because browser only 
        support the HTML, CSS and Javascript. And for Create Elements using JSX 
        is not supported so babel convert JSX file into the seprate js and html 
        file and provide support of jsx on the Browser.

    Babel is a toolchain that's mainly used to converts the ES6+ javascript code 
    into a backward compatible version of javascript to Provide More Browser Support
    for a Perticular Web Application

/*
    Babel is also a third party library so we have two options to use babel one 
    is CDN which we used already and another one is install the Whole Babel Package 
    into the system. So we use the CDN to use the Babel in Our file.

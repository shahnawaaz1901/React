/*
    React is Declarative Library which describe what you want to do and how 
    what you dont want to do. Means we tell browser to create a heading and 
    browser will create heading for you just like we create heading in HTML
    just writing h1 tag but this declarative not present in javascript, because
    javascript is imperative language means we need to tell each and every 
    step in javascript but this is not in case of react

    Multipage Application : Multipage applications is traditional way to create 
                applications where for every task a reload is happening and multiple 
                html document is create for every single task. Or We can understand
                multipage application those where reload is happening while user
                interacts with the App. Multi Page Application is Search Engine 
                Optimization Friendly where Search Engine Ranked each page. That's
                why Amazon and Other E-Commerce applications uses MPA. In Multi Page
                Application Post request is send to the server and Whole html document
                server send to the client

    Singlepage Application : Single Page application is the modern way to create
                applications where a single html document is present and reload
                is happening only once. And when ever user interacts with the
                application changes made dynamically without reload web page again
                and again using ajax request to the server for any information.
                Against AJAX Request a JSON response is sends back to the client

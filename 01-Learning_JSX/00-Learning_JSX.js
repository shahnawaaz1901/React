/*
    JSX : JSX Stands for "Javascript XML", which is nothing but the 
        extension of Javascript Syntax. Which Provides react to be
        declarative. JSX is just the syntactic suger over the react
        Code which is written in Javascript.

*/

/*
    Why JSX : 
    - Because using JSX, React embrace the fact that "rendering logic and 
        UI logic" we can put together
    - JSX work as "visual aid" while working wit UI inside Javascript.
    - React "Seprate Concerns" means with react we can devide multiple things 
        of UI into multiple components But in normal HTML & Javascript we 
        only seprate both the technology into multiple files but then we
        are not seprate each and every area of UI
    - JSX Allows react to show more "Useful Errors" and as Warning Messages

/*
    Styled Component : Styled Component is nothing but a third party library 
        which helps us to write css in javascript, this eleminated the many 
        problem like normal css file has the global scope but the styled 
        component is has the local scope, so in this we can style a single
        component and use that component easily, another benefits is there is
        no clashes between component classes because of the local scope

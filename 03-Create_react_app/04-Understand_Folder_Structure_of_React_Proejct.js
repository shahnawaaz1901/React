        installing the Library using the command "npm install", but we can

        Local Installation :
        - npm i package_name

        Global Installation :

    install the library usign the npm i command and whole dependencies of the 
    project is started to install, then there are two folders src and public
    where src contains the server files which helps us to run our front end
    project over the server on localhost and client contains the static files

    and in public folder one file index.html has which is the main file of our
    project

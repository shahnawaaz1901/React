/*
    For Starting the Project we need to install create-react-app globally so 
    whenever we want to start new Project we start using the create-react-app 
    and the name of the project, so for install the create-react-app globally
    we need to give few command :

        npm i -g create-react-app
    
    -g means we want to install globally

    After installing the create-react-app globally, if we want to start new react 
    project then we can start using command :
    create-react-app project_name 
    then a folder with the projectname is created and some prewritten code is there 
    in src and public folder and as well as package.json and package-lock.json

    One thing that we need to remember that projectname is always in small letter
    any capital letter cause of an error in terminal

    if we are not installed the create-react-app globally and still want to create
    a project then we create project by just writing an keyword npx at the start,
    just like this command :

    npx create-react-app projectname

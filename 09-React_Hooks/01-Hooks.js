/*
    Hooks : Hooks are nothing but Functions that let you hook into React State 
        and lifeCycle Features from functional Component. Hooks are introduced
        in React v16.8

    As we learn so far React has state and lifecycle methods but we can't access 
    that lifecycle methods into the functional component but with Using hooks we
    can use states and all the lifecycle methods( which we learnt for Class based
    components ) into the functional Component.

    Note : Hooks can't be used in class based components because class based 
        components already have the state and lifecycle methods.

/*
    Custom Hooks : React Provides us the functionalities to Design and 
        create our own hooks called custom hooks.

    Suppose we have a login like in a ecom app amazon, in that application
    we enter our email and we forgot the password then we click on password
    reset form and when we click on that form a forgot password form is 
    render on the screen which already contains our email address but now 
    question is where from this email comes this means our email is stored
    somewhere so that amazon webpage takes my email from there, this is done
    by using the custom hooks because customs hooks provides us to prevent
    the repetative tasks and gives the functionality to pass the stateful 
    logic between multiple components, however we can do this withOut the
    custom hooks but custom hooks provides us to do same task withOut doing
    the same repetative task

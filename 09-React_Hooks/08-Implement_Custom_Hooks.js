/*
    Custom Hooks : Custom Hooks helps us to share the logic between the 
            components and make them reusable like a function, but for 
            the custom hooks we need to take care of few things :

    1. Always starts hook name with the use.
    2. Always followed the hookName after the "use" keyword with the Capital 
        Letter.

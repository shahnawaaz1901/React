/*
    localStorage : localStorage is the browser based API, where we can 
            store data temporarily on the browser .Because local Storage
            is the Browser API so that this is also called as side Effect
            so in functional component we need to perform sideEffect inside
            useEffect function which is a Hook provide us by the React.
            we can set and retrieve data on the localStorage, Syntax for 
            localStorage is :

            For set the value :
            localStorage.setItem("key_name",value);

            for get the value :
            localStorage.getItem("key_name");
